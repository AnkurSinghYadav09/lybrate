                    Overwhelmed is a term that expresses how you may feel when you bring home your newborn!
                     You're obliged to have doubts about everything from breastfeeding to bathing your baby and changing 
                     their nappy, if new to the journey of parenthood. 
                     Confusion might scurry through the mind as you try to meet all of your baby’s needs.

                    A newborn can be extremely challenging for the first few days and it may seem like
                     an endless round of breastfeeding and changing diapers.
                     Here is the basic care that your baby needs during these early days
                </li>
                <li>
                    Newborn babies do not arrive with a guidance manual, and to begin with, it is completely 
                    normal to have lots of questions about their health and development.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Breastfeed your baby as frequently as they want and probably you and your baby will get into a pattern.
                     Let them decide when they are full and the amount of milk you produce will alter, accordingly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the first few days, wash your baby’s face, hands and bottom carefully.
                     You may need warm water, a towel, fresh nappy and clean clothes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your newborn requires regular nappy changes. Do not leave them in
                     a dirty nappy for too long as this can cause skin soreness or nappy rash.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It's common for new babies to sleep only for 2 to 3 hours in the night, 
                    as well as during the day since babies are not tuned into day and night yet. 
                    As your baby grows, they'll gradually start to sleep for longer at night.
                </li>
